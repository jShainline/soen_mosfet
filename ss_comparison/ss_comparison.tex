\section{\label{sec:introduction}Introduction}
Lay out the problem: 

\section{\label{sec:neural_device_requirements}Device requirements for neuromorphic systems}
	
\section{\label{sec:light_sources}Light Sources}
Short section, pointing out we're trying to consider systems with similar light sources, hopefully silicon, operated at low temp. Temp could be 77K or 40K or 4K, but we'll try to assume it doesn't matter. 
	
\section{\label{sec:interconnection}Interconnection network and fan-out}
Similarly to \ref{sec:light_sources}, we want to assume semi and super systems are using the same concepts and hardware for the interconnection network. Fan-out (out degree) is constrained to be the same for the two systems, so light sources and transmitter driver circuits must be scaled to produce the appropriate number of photons.

\section{Notes}
Differences between neural and digital optical communication:
\begin{itemize}
\item neural: mux/demux not required
\item neural: high power optical signals not necessary (nor tolerable)
\item neural: not point to point, one to many
\item neural: asynchronous, no clock, no phase-locked loop, no clock recovery on receive
\item neural: 1s and 0s not equally common; signals are sparse
\item neural: TIA + limiting amplifier + decision circuit likely uses too much power
\item neural: noise is more tolerable, decision circuit still potentially useful
\item neural: speed can be much lower, as demonstrated by biology
\item neural: with lower light levels, light-source driver circuits don't need to deliver as much current
\item multi-chip partitioning required for digital due to high speed and sensitivity to timing jitter, multi-chip not tolerable for neural (cannot have multiple chips for each neuron) Tx and Rx amplifiers cannot remain in isolation (\cite{ra2012} pg. 5)
\item neural: bits are not sampled on a clock
\end{itemize}

other notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item in conventional optical communication systems, package parasitics limit speed. optoelectronic integration crucial for overcoming this limitation (\cite{ra2012} pg. 5)
\item for long time constants, semiconductors can augment RC by op amp gain: $RC \rightarrow (1+A)RC$, where $A$ is the op amp gain, which can be enormous, like 300,000. thus, essentially arbitrarily long time constants can be achieved. the price is power.
\item regarding subthreshold oscillations, RLC behavior in semiconductors can be achieved with op amps. in this case, there is no inductor, and that role is played by the active op amp. the price is power
\end{itemize}
